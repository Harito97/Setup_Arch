**A Fun Guide to Installing [Arch Linux](https://github.com/archlinux)**

# Prepare the USB Boot Drive

**Step 1**: Download the latest Arch Linux ISO from the [official Arch Linux website](https://archlinux.org/download/). Always use the latest version to avoid installation issues. Trying to use an older version can lead to unexpected errors - trust me (3 times try and wasted time for it: 12 Dec 2024), it's not worth it!

**Step 2**: Use the `dd` command to write the ISO to your USB drive. Example:

```bash
sudo dd if=path_to_archlinux.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress && sync
```

Make sure to replace `path_to_archlinux.iso` with the location of your downloaded ISO, and `/dev/sdX` with the correct device identifier for your USB drive (e.g., `/dev/sdb`). **Be careful with the device path to avoid overwriting important data**.

**Step 3**: Once the `dd` command is complete, you're done! Safely eject your USB drive.

# Prepare Disk Partitions

Before proceeding with the installation, **back up your important data**. I usually back up everything to specific partitions like `/dev/sda3:399GB` and `/dev/sdb:250GB` on my `night` laptop (`day` laptop will be setup a little difference), but you should use whatever partitions make sense for you.

To check your disk partitions, you can use tools like `df`, `lsblk`, or `fdisk`:

This will help you confirm your partitions and ensure your important data is safe before proceeding with any changes.

# Boot from the USB

Insert the USB drive into your computer and power it on. **Press `Esc` or a specific key** (like `F12`, `F2`, or `DEL`) to access the boot menu, then select the USB drive as the boot device.

From here, you can either follow the [official Arch Linux installation guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide) for a more customized setup or use the easier, automated approach with `archinstall`.

I prefer using `archinstall`, which is included by default in the Arch Linux ISO. The configuration file I use is available in [this asset](./asset/0.install_arch/archinstall_config_example.json).

# Partition Setup

For my installation, I follow this basic partition scheme:
- `/boot`
- `/` (root)
- `/home`
- Other partitions for data and project backups.

After you've configured `archinstall`, run the setup and let it finish the installation.

Once the installation is complete, **reboot** your system. You're done!

Now you've successfully installed Arch Linux! Enjoy the flexibility and control that Arch provides.
