**Managing Disks and Partitions with Auto-Mounting**

As a user of multiple partitions on my disks, I often need to ensure that necessary partitions are automatically mounted each time the system boots.

# Managing Disks and Partitions

To streamline the mounting process, I utilize `/etc/fstab`, a configuration file that allows partitions to be automatically mounted at boot. Additionally, the following commands are useful for managing and inspecting disk partitions:

- `fdisk`: For partitioning disks.
- `lsblk`: To list information about block devices.
- `df`: To check disk space usage.

To begin, you can list the available devices under `/dev` and check disk usage with `df`:

```bash
ls /dev
df -h
```

Example output and setup **in `night` laptop**:

```
/dev/sda1       511M  184M  328M  37% /boot
/dev/sda2       275G  131M  260G   1% /home
/dev/sda4       274G  5.1G  255G   2% /
```

In this example, `/dev/sda3` and `/dev/sdb1` are still available for project backups and data saver.

# Setting Up Auto-Mounting with `fstab`

To configure partitions for automatic mounting, edit the `/etc/fstab` file. This file contains the necessary information for the system to mount partitions at boot.

The general syntax for adding a new entry in `/etc/fstab` is:

```
<device> <mount_point> <filesystem_type> <options> <dump> <pass>
```

For example, if I want to mount `/dev/sda3` to `/projects` and `/dev/sdb1` to `/data` in **`night` laptop, I would add entries like the following:

```bash
/dev/sda3   /projects   ext4    defaults    0   2
/dev/sdb1   /data	ext4    defaults    0   2
```

After that, I manally create the mount point:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /data
sudo mkdir -p /projects
# Replace with your setup
```

# Final Steps

Once youâ€™ve updated `/etc/fstab`, save the file and then mount all the listed partitions to verify that the system can automatically mount them:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload	
# make sure that systemd uses the most up-to-date version of fstab
sudo mount -a
# then mount
```

This guide should help you efficiently manage disk partitions and set up automatic mounting at boot for a smooth experience on your system.
